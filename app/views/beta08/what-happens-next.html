      <p>You&rsquo;ll get a decision before Tuesday, 21 March.</p>
      <p>If youâ€™re offered a loan you&rsquo;ll be told:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>how much you can borrow</li>
        <li>how much your weekly repayments will be</li>
        <li>how long it will take to repay</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can then decide whether to accept the loan.</p>

      <p>If you&rsquo;re not offered a loan, then you&rsquo;ll be told the reason why. You have the right to ask for a review if you&rsquo;re not happy with the decision.</p>
